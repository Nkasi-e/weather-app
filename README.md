# weather-site
This application helps search for the current weather of any valid location
It returns an error message when an invalid serach term is entered to the search input
The front end wasn't really focus on when building the weather application
I used hbs npm library for dyanamic templating and also used express npm library to build the backend of this application
I used postman-request npm library to fetch weatherstack api and also mapbox geocode api for the weather data
